##### Assorted Browser Extensions  

<p>I have always had very specific browers requirements. It is personal preference, but I like certain sites to behave in different ways. I never liked the one-size-fits-all Dark Mode. So I have created a variety of different packages for allowing you to change browsing experience on a variety of sites. These are not extensively maintained, but they are not so complex that updating or changing for your own requirements would be an issue</p>

###### FIREFOX
* Hacker News Color Selector - hndarkmode - Exactly what it sounds like

###### CHROME
* Netsuite Color Palette - Specific pallete for Oracle Netsuite (since Oracle hasn't managed to build a dark mode for this software.)
